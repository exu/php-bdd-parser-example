* Simple file parser created with Behat and PHPSpec

What it should do ? Look at =parser.feature= file in =features/= directory

** Installation

This project is based on composer so you will need it. To
install composer. I prefer installing composer globally so
everything what you should do is

#+begin_src sh
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Next you should clone repository and run =composer install= command
to download and resolve all dependencies (composer will do it automatically).

#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:exu/php-bdd-parser-example.git
cd php-bdd-parser-example
composer install
#+end_src

** Run some tests :)

#+begin_src sh
bin/behat
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
bin/phpspec --format=pretty
#+end_src

** Running application

If You want to run parser:

#+begin_src sh
bin/console parse
#+end_src



** Bonus

Try to change feature file e.g. with other data in tables
it will really fail :)


** Enjoy!
